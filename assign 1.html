  <h1>My Favorite Hobby: Photography</h1>
  
  <h2>Why I Love Photography</h2>
  <p><b>Photography</b> is more than just a hobby to me—it's a way of <i>capturing memories</i> and freezing moments in time. It allows me to express my creativity and see the world from unique angles.</p>
  <p>I started taking pictures with my phone, and soon I was hooked. <u>The feeling of clicking a perfect shot is unmatched.</u> <br>Now I carry my DSLR wherever I go, always ready to capture nature, people, and candid emotions.</p>

  <h3>What I Use</h3>
  <p>I currently use a <b>Canon EOS 1500D</b> and a <i>tripod</i> for stable shots. I also enjoy editing my photos using <u>Lightroom</u> to enhance lighting and color balance.</p>

  <!-- Section 3: Daily Routine -->
  <h1>My Daily Routine</h1>

  <h2>Morning</h2>
  <p><b>I usually wake up at 6:30 AM.</b> I start my day with a quick <i>stretch and some meditation</i> to refresh my mind. After that, I take a shower and enjoy a light breakfast while reading the news. <br><u>By 8:00 AM</u>, I begin my studies or work tasks for the day.</p>

  <h2>Afternoon</h2>
  <p>After a productive morning, I take a lunch break around 1:00 PM. I try to eat healthy—rice, dal, and vegetables are my go-to. Then I usually relax for a bit, maybe <i>read a book or take a short nap</i>, before getting back to more work or attending online classes.</p>

  <h2>Evening</h2>
  <p>The evening is for winding down. I go for a walk or sometimes <b>click photographs during sunset</b>. After returning home, I help with household chores or watch a documentary. <u>By 10:30 PM</u>, I call it a day and go to bed.</p>
